pg 20:

  Short Circuit Evaluation:

	console.log( null || "user" )
	// -> user
	console.log("Agnes" || "user")
	// -> Agnes

"If you have a value that might be empty you can put ||
after it with a replacement value."

"If the initial value can be converted to false, you'll
get the replacement instead."

(don't forget that: )
(0, NaN, and "" are all false)


&& works similarly, just opposite
	false && X
	// -> false (regardless of X)
